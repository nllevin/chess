# chess

To play a game of chess, enter into the terminal:
\nruby game.rb

Known issues/potential areas for improvement: 
1) the board is oblong, not square, and too small
2) more complicated maneuvers like en passant and castling are not implemented
3) currently only supports human vs. human play, but could add ComputerPlayer later
